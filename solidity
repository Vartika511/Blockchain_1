+First we start with writing the version of solidity we are using.
   - >=0.6.0 <0.9.0 (it can use any from 0.6.0 to 0.9.0)
   - 0.6.3 (it will use spcified version only)
   - ^0.6.0 (it uses version starting from 0.6.0 to 0.6.12)

+Types of variables in solidity
   - Booleans
         bool: The possible values are constants true and false.
   - INTEGER
        int / uint: Signed and unsigned integers of various sizes. Keywords uint8 
         to uint256 in steps of 8 (unsigned of 8 up to 256 bits) and int8 to int256. 
    - FIXED POINT NUMBER
       fixed / ufixed: Signed and unsigned fixed point number of various sizes. Keywords ufixedMxN and fixedMxN, 
       where M represents the number of bits taken by the type and N represents how many decimal points are available. 
       M must be divisible by 8 and goes from 8 to 256 bits. N must be between 0 and 80, inclusive. 
    - Address
       address: Holds a 20 byte value (size of an Ethereum address).
       address payable: Same as address, but with the additional members transfer and send.
    The idea behind this distinction is that address payable is an address you can send Ether to, while a plain address cannot be sent Ether.
    - Fixed-size byte arrays
       The value types bytes1, bytes2, bytes3, â€¦, bytes32 hold a sequence of bytes from one to up to 32.
       bytes: Dynamically-sized byte array, see Arrays.
       string: Dynamically-sized UTF-8-encoded string, see Arrays.

+There are 4 types of VISIBILITY
    - external
     External functions are part of the contract interface, which means they can be called from other contracts and via transactions.
      An external function f cannot be called internally (i.e. f() does not work, but this.f() works).
    - public
      Public functions are part of the contract interface and can be either called internally or via messages.
       For public state variables, an automatic getter function (see below) is generated.
    - internal
       Those functions and state variables can only be accessed internally (i.e. from within the current contract
       or contracts deriving from it), without using this. #This is the default visibility level for state variables.
    - private
       Private functions and state variables are only visible for the contract they are defined in and not in derived contracts.
+There are 3 types of Modifiers
    - pure
      Disallows modification or access of state.
      which do maths.
      they just view and makes no changes in contract.
    - view
      Disallows modification of state.
      they read something
      By default public variables are view modifiers.
      they just view and makes no changes in contract.
    - payable
      Allows them to receive Ether together with a call.
      they make changes in contract.
+Arrays - A way of storing a list of an object or type.
   -Dynamic Array --> An array that can change size.
   -Fixed Array --> An array that can not change size.
+Data can be stored in two ways
<<<<<<< HEAD
   Memory:
         Data will only be stored during the execution of the function.
         (delete it after execution)
   Storage:
=======
     Memory:
         Data will only be stored during the execution of the function.
         (delete it after execution)
     Storage:
>>>>>>> 25d0b28e4d6591a858d8079534d2fd1b05fa2697
         They will persist even after the function executes.
         (keep it forever)
   (String is an object so we need to decide were to store it.)      
+Mappings: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
          A dictionary like data structure, with 1 value per key.
